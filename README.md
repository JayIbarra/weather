# Weather Dashboard

This weather outlook dashboard is powered by CSS, JavaScript & HTML. It also uses bootstrap and OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities.

The goal of this application is to be able to search for multiple cities, view your search history, and understand the current weather in those cities.
